2. Type a country name in the search box (auto-complete will help)
3. Submit your guess by pressing Enter or clicking a suggestion
4. If incorrect, you'll see:
   - Distance in miles to the correct country
   - Direction arrow pointing toward the correct country
   - Your guess added to the history with a color indicating proximity
5. The world map on the right shows all your guesses with color coding:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Correct answer
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Very close (<500 miles)
   - ðŸŸ  Orange: Close (<1,500 miles)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Medium distance (<3,000 miles)
